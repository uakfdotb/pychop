The pychop++ project aims to create a stable and secure core program that allows plugins to have a high degree of control over most objects and to develop extensive plugins that will support almost all user needs. Besides the plugin system, no new features will actually be added directly to pychop++; instead, issues such as memory leaks will be resolved. The plugin system will also be developed to make plugins more powerful. Then, the project can produce new plugins that give features to only those users who need them.

Originally, this project was simply going to provide patch files that could modify chop++ to support features plugins would now support. However, it was found that the python plugin system from pyghost++ was easy to convert to pychop++ because of the similarities between the two original projects, ghost++ and chop++ (chop++ is a modification of ghost++ that strips hosting functions and adds channel operator ones).
